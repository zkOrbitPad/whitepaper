# 4âƒ£ Vote listing

Orbitpad will introduce a voting listing feature. What does this entail? It's essentially a voting system where the Orbitpad community collectively determines the viability of projects for launch on the Orbitpad platform. The outcome of the vote holds significant weight and will be adhered to. All projects seeking listing are required to undergo this voting process, and the community's decision will ultimately dictate their approval or rejection.\

**Governance Voting: Empowering Community Voices**

A truly decentralized ecosystem cannot thrive without meaningful community involvement in decision-making processes. OrbitPad acknowledges this fundamental principle and introduces a robust governance voting system, wherein token holders can actively participate in shaping the future of the platform and its supported projects.

Through on-chain governance, stakeholders can propose and vote on important matters, such as platform upgrades, token utility adjustments, and listing decisions. This democratic approach to decision-making ensures that the community's collective wisdom guides OrbitPad's growth, sustainability, and adherence to its core principles of transparency and fairness.\
